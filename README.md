# Background
This is a script that lets you get an edge on booking the Pokémon café. A lot of secondary markets have emerged on fiverr and other e-commerce sites that provide this service for $$$ since Pokémon café reservation website is generally unprotected from botting (and thus are absolute flooded with bots):

It made me upset, so I made this and open-sourced it. I've already personally had success with it!

Basically the script clicks through the terms pages and goes back and forth on the selected date until "Available" appears on the booking time table.
